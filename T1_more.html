    <!-- Basic Info -->
    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p>
      The tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most widely cultivated crops worldwide.  
      It originated in western South America and was domesticated in Mexico.  
      Tomatoes are rich in vitamins A, C, K, and potassium, making them an essential part of a healthy diet.  
      They are used in salads, soups, sauces, juices, and countless cuisines around the globe.  
      The plant is usually grown as an annual but can be perennial in tropical regions.  
      Tomatoes thrive in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight.  
      They are sensitive to frost and require staking or caging for better growth.  
      The tomato plant grows upright with hairy stems and yellow flowers.  
      The fruits vary in size, shape, and color (red, yellow, green, purple).  
      They are botanically classified as berries.  
      Tomatoes play a vital role in the economy of many countries.  
      Lycopene, the red pigment in tomatoes, acts as a powerful antioxidant.  
      This compound is linked to health benefits such as reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.  
      Tomato farming requires regular irrigation and pest management.  
      Crop rotation is recommended to prevent soil-borne diseases.  
      The average life cycle of a tomato plant is about 3‚Äì4 months.  
      Hybrid and genetically improved varieties are grown for higher yields.  
      Tomatoes can be grown in fields, greenhouses, or pots at home.  
      Organic cultivation is increasing in popularity for health-conscious consumers.  
      Despite challenges like diseases and pests, tomatoes remain the second most important vegetable worldwide.

    <h2>How to Solve Tomato Plant Issues</h2>
    <p>
      To effectively solve tomato plant issues, farmers must adopt an integrated disease and pest management approach.  
      Start by planting resistant varieties and using certified seeds.  
      Practice crop rotation and avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil consecutively.  
      Ensure proper irrigation methods like drip irrigation to prevent water logging.  
      Maintain adequate spacing between plants for good airflow.  
      Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent disease spread.  
      Apply bio-fertilizers and organic compost to strengthen plant immunity.  
      Regular monitoring of fields is essential to detect early signs of disease.  
      Use recommended pesticides carefully, following dosage instructions.  
      Promote natural predators (like ladybugs) to control pests organically.  
      Maintain weed-free fields as weeds act as hosts for pests and diseases.  
      Prune lower leaves to reduce fungal infections.  
      Solarize the soil before planting to kill harmful pathogens.  
      Avoid over-fertilization with nitrogen, which increases disease risk.  
      Spray neem oil or other biopesticides for eco-friendly pest control.  
      Use protective nets in nurseries to avoid insect-borne viruses.  
      Farmers should be trained in integrated pest management (IPM).  
      Ultimately, combining organic methods with minimal chemical use ensures healthy and sustainable tomato cultivation.
